# Button

Use buttons to initialize an important action or to highlight the user journey.

## Type Usage

| Type | Usage |
|----|----|
| Primary | The Button filled with the Porsche brand color. This type is only to be used for one or two first priority actions within a page in order to give the user optimal guidance. |
| Secondary | Default button with monochrome color fill. To be used for all other stand-alone Buttons that aren't high priority. |
| Tertiary | An "outline only" version of the Porsche Button. In hierarchy it is always subordinated to the filled views and can be used in two different cases: 1. In combination with a filled Button (Primary or Secondary), for example in popular pairings such as "submit" (Primary or Secondary) and "cancel" (Tertiary). 2. Stand-alone, when the priority of the action is lower compared to all other Button actions within this page. |
